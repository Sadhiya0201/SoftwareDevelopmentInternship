Task 2 – Number Pattern Generator

Cognifyz Software Development Internship
Level: Beginner

 Objective:

To generate and display simple number patterns using loop structures (for loops).
This task helps in understanding nested loops, pattern formation, and console-based structured output.

 Task Description:

You are required to:

Select a number pattern (e.g., pyramid, inverted pyramid, right-aligned pyramid).

Develop a program that generates the selected pattern.

Use loops to control the structure and spacing of the pattern.

Verify the correctness of the printed output.

This program prints three different number patterns:

a.Number Pyramid

b.Inverted Number Pyramid

c.Right-Aligned Number Pyramid

 Concepts Used:

1.Nested loops

2.Incremental and decremental iteration

3.String formatting and spacing

4.User input handling

Source Code File:
Task-2.py

 How to Run the Program:
Step 1: Open Terminal / Command Prompt

Navigate to the folder containing Task-2.py.

Step 2: Run the Script
python Task-2.py

Step 3: Enter Input

Example input:

Enter the number of rows: 5

Expected Output
Pattern 1 – Number Pyramid
1
12
123
1234
12345

Pattern 2 – Inverted Number Pyramid
12345
1234
123
12
1

Pattern 3 – Right-Aligned Pyramid
    1
   12
  123
 1234
12345

Output Video:

The folder includes:

Task2output.mp4


The video demonstrates:

a.Running the program.

b.Entering the number of rows.

c.Display of all three patterns.
