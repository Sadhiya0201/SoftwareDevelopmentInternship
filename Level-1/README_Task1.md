📄 README – Task 1: Treasure Escape Challenge (Text-Based Game)

Project Title:

Treasure Escape Challenge.

Task 1: Text-Based Game (Beginner Level)

Developer:

## D. Sadhiya

1. Project Overview:

Treasure Escape Challenge is an interactive text-based adventure game created in Python.
The player is trapped inside a mysterious cave with three tunnels, and each tunnel hides a different fate:

💰 Treasure – You win

👹 Monster – You lose

🔓 Secret Escape Route – You escape the cave safely

The game uses conditional statements, loops, functions, and random choices to create a unique result every time the game is played.

This fulfills Task 1 of the Software Development Internship.
