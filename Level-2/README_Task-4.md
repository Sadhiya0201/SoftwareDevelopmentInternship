README – Task 4: Temperature Converter
Cognifyz Technologies – Software Development Internship
Task Objective:

The objective of Task 4 is to develop a simple, menu-based Temperature Converter Program in Python that:

a.Accepts a temperature value from the user

b.Allows choosing the conversion direction

c.Correctly converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit

d.Displays the final converted output

This program demonstrates conditional logic, functions, user input, and mathematical operations.

Features Implemented
✔ 1. Temperature Input

The program accepts numeric input from the user (float or integer).

✔ 2. Celsius → Fahrenheit Conversion

Uses the formula:

F = (C × 9/5) + 32

✔ 3. Fahrenheit → Celsius Conversion

Uses the formula:

C = (F - 32) × 5/9

✔ 4. User Menu

A menu is displayed with three options:

a.Celsius to Fahrenheit.

b.Fahrenheit to Celsius.

c.Exit

✔ 5. Loop Until User Chooses Exit

The program allows repeated conversions until the user selects option 3.

Technologies Used:

1.Python 3.x.

2.Console I/O.

F3.unctions and conditionals.

How to Run the Program:

Open Terminal / Command Prompt.

Navigate to the directory:

Run the program:

python Task-4.py

Example Output:
===== Temperature Converter =====

1. Celsius to Fahrenheit
2. Fahrenheit to Celsius
3. Exit
   Enter your choice: 1
   Enter temperature in Celsius: 37
   37°C = 98.60°F

Test Cases:
Input Conversion Expected Output
0°C C → F 32°F
100°C C → F 212°F
32°F F → C 0°C
98.6°F F → C 37°C
Output Demonstration

The included video Task-4outputvideo.mp4 shows:

✔ Running the Python script
✔ Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit
✔ Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius
✔ Multiple test inputs
✔ Program exit

Conclusion:

This program successfully fulfills the requirements of Task 4 by implementing a clear, user-friendly temperature converter using Python. It showcases good understanding of:

a.Mathematical logic.

b.Menu-driven programs.

c.User input handling.

d.Conditional statements.
