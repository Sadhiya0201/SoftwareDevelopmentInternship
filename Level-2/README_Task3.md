README – Task 3: Python Console CRUD Application
Cognifyz Technologies – Software Development Internship
Task Objective:

The goal of Task 3 is to build a Python console-based application that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of tasks.
This application uses classes, lists, and console input to simulate a simple task manager system.

Features Implemented:
✔ 1. Create Task

User can enter title, description, and status

Automatically generates unique Task ID

Saves created time

✔ 2. Read / View Tasks

List all tasks in the system

View a specific task using its ID

✔ 3. Update Task

User can update:

Title

Description

Status

Empty input keeps the old value

✔ 4. Delete Task

User enters the Task ID

Task gets removed from the list

✔ 5. Console Menu System

Repeats until the user chooses Exit

Validates inputs

Very easy to use

Technologies Used:

Python 3.x

Console Input / Output

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Lists for in-memory storage

How to Run the Program:

Open terminal / command prompt

Navigate to project folder:

Run the program:

python Task-3.py

Example Status Values:

Use any of these:

Status Meaning
TODO Not started
IN_PROGRESS Currently working
DONE Completed

If you press Enter without typing, default = TODO

Output Demonstration

A video named Task-3outputvideo.mp4 is included showing:

✔ Creating tasks
✔ Listing tasks
✔ Viewing a task
✔ Updating task details
✔ Deleting a task
✔ Exiting the application

This fulfills the output requirement from Cognifyz.

Sample Output
====== TASK MANAGER ======

1. Create Task
2. List Tasks
3. View Task
4. Update Task
5. Delete Task
6. Exit
   Enter choice: 1

--- Create Task ---
Enter Title: Study Python
Enter Description: Practice CRUD concepts
Enter Status (TODO / IN_PROGRESS / DONE): TODO
Task created successfully!

Conclusion

This project completes Task 3 of the Cognifyz Software Development Internship by successfully implementing a fully functional CRUD console application in Python. The task demonstrates strong concepts of:

a.OOP

b.Python list operations

c.User input handling

d.Menu-driven programming
